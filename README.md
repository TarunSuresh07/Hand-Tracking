Hello Developers/Coders
Hi 
This a repository for Hand Tracking using python by Spider Developer and that me!!!!!!!

Please scroll down for more infomation!!!!!

# NOTE
THIS PROJECT IS A YOUTUBE TUTORIAL FROM A CHANNEL CALLED Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI

THE QUALITY AND SMOOTHESS AND SPEED OF PROGRAM DEPENDS ON YOUR PC AND WEBCAM!!!!!!!!! SO DON'T BLAME ME FOR SLOWER PERFORMANCE

# Libraries

These points can used for using particular points or landmarks for different things such as Controlling Volume using thumb tip and index finger tip project (Not Included!)

So You can also use these points for different project 
So I also included a picture of the points or landmarks in finger (Found here and also at files!)

With the module script you can reduce the size of code and difficult to understand and used for many projects easily
There is also simple code

But I will recommended to use Module script itself for faster and easy coding!!!!!! 
Some photos for example
